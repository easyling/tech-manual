# Translation Memories

The Translation Proxy can use translation memories to aid in the pre-translation of the site. Memories can be imported from standards-compliant TMX files, or can be populated from the project itself. Once a memory has been created, it will remain accessible to the user across projects, to be used for pre-translation. Memories can also be exported in the same TMX format they are imported in.

During pre-translation, confidence level thresholds can be set for using the memory contents, as well as for automatically confirming these entries. Several memories can be assigned to a given project, and pre-translation will use all of them at once to draw translations from, however, only the default memory can be written to on the project.
